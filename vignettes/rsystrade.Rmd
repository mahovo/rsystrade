# About
*rsystrade* is a framwork for researching, testing and executing systematic trading strategies.


# Philosophy
The intention is to provide as much transparency as possible about how things are calculated. So all functions that implement a formula live in the file `formulas.R`.

The intention is *not* to veil calculations in an endless maze of OOP abstractions.
